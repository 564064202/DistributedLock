* Consider destructor to avoid the connection pool re-acquisition issue (to avoid the finalizable object in a finalizer issue, we'd have to have the scope
object hold an object which keys into a conditional weak table that holds the transaction)
* Consider providing a hook into when we lose connection to SQL (connection state changed event)
* Consider an option for using distributed transactions w/transaction scope instead of holding connections open (probably bad because we don't know where else the scope will flow)
